h1. DueTimer

Timer Library to work with Arduino DUE


h2. Getting Started

To call a function @handler@ every @1000@ microseconds:

pre. Timer3.attachInterrupt(handler).start(1000);
or:
Timer3.attachInterrupt(handler).setPeriod(1000).start();

To call a function @handler@ 10 times a second:

pre. Timer3.attachInterrupt(handler).setFrequency(10).start();

In case you need to stop a timer, just do like this:

pre. Timer3.stop();

And to continue running:

pre. Timer3.start();

There are 6 Timer objects already instantied for you:
@Timer0@, @Timer1@, @Timer2@, @Timer3@, @Timer4@ and @Timer5@.

h3. TIPs

* Prefer to use @Timer3@, @Timer4@ and @Timer5@ since they have no connection to hardware pins.

pre. Timer4.attatchInterrupt(handler).setFrequency(10).start();
is the same as:
Timer4.attatchInterrupt(handler);
Timer4.setFrequency(10);
Timer4.start();

pre. To create a custom timer, refer to:
DueTimer myTimer = DueTimer(0); // Creates a Timer 0 object.
DueTimer myTimer = DueTimer(3); // Creates a Timer 3 object.
Note: Maximum allowed is 5, otherwise it won't work...

h2. Library Reference

h3. You should know:

- @attachInterrupt(void (*isr)())@ := Attach a interrupt (callback function) for the timer of the object.

- @start(long microseconds = -1)@ := Start the timer with an optional period parameter.

- @stop()@ := Stop the timer

- @setFrequency(long frequency)@ := Set the timer frequency

- @setPeriod(long microseconds)@ := Set the timer period (in microseconds)

h3. You don't need to know:

- @int timer@ := Stores the object timer id (to acces Timers struct array).

- @DueTimer(int _timer)@ := Instantiate a new DueTimer object for Timer _timer (NOTE: All objects are already instantied!).

- @static const Timer Timers[]@ := Stores all timers information

- @static void (*callbacks[])()@ := Stores all callbacks for all timers


h2. Version History

* @1.0 (2013-30-03): Original release@.
